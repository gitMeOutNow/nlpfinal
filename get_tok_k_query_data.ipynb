We demonstrate here that '\n"," 'the theory offers one explanation for the framing effect observed by '\n"," 'Sonnemans et al. (1998) .To put our approach in context, it is important to '\n"," 'recognize that the framing effect observed by Sonnemans et al. (1998) was a '\n"," 'dynamic one. Initially, the success rate in both frames was similar, but in '\n"," 'the public bad frame, it subsequently declined, whereas in the public good '\n"," 'frame, it did not. The key to explaining the framing effect is, therefore, '\n"," 'to explain why the success rate declined in the public bad frame. Sonnemans '\n"," 'et al. (1998) proposed a theoretical model that can capture this decline and '\n"," 'argued, through simulations, that the success rate in the public bad frame '\n"," 'would typically converge to zero. The impulse balance theory is ideally '\n"," 'suited to study such dynamic effects (Cartwright & Stepanova, 2017; Goerg et '\n"," 'al., 2016) . And interestingly, the model proposed by Sonnemans et al. '\n"," '(1998) is very similar in spirit to the impulse balance theory (which had '\n"," 'not been developed at that time).We demonstrate that the impulse balance '\n"," 'theory allows us to make sharp predictions on when the framing effect will '\n"," 'be large and small.2 It can also predict when success rates will converge to '\n"," 'zero. The results of Sonnemans et al. (1998) are consistent with our '\n"," 'predictions but it is desirable to do further tests because the effect they '\n"," 'observed, while statistically significant, was not particularly large. '\n"," 'Moreover, Iturbe-Ormaetxe, Ponti, Tomás, and Ubeda (2011) and Kotani, '\n"," 'Managi, and Tanaka (2008) obtain contrasting results. This can be explained '\n"," 'by the fact they considered, respectively, stranger matching and a '\n"," 'constantly changing environment, neither of which allows time for learning '\n"," '(which is critical to the impulse balance theory). 3 Even so, it is '\n"," 'desirable to have more evidence. We, therefore, designed a new experiment in '\n"," 'which we consider a setting where the framing effect is predicted to be '\n"," 'small and one where it is predicted to be large.Our experimental results (in '\n"," 'both the United Kingdom and China) are consistent with the theoretical '\n"," 'predictions. First, similar to Sonnemans et al. (1998) , we found that the '\n"," 'success rate in providing the public good was significantly higher with the '\n"," 'public good than public bad framing. Second, we found, as predicted, that '\n"," 'the size of the framing effect was attenuated by changes in the return from '\n"," 'the public good. Specifically, when the return from the public good was '\n"," '\"large,\" the framing effect was relatively small. But, when the return from '\n"," 'the public good was \"small,\" the framing effect was relatively large. As '\n"," 'well as endorsing the predictions of the impulse balance theory, this result '\n"," 'also shows that the size of framing effects can systematically depend on '\n"," 'incentives in the game.The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we work '\n"," 'through the public good frame, and in Section 3, we work through the public '\n"," 'bad frame. Section 4 contains our main theoretical results. Section 5 '\n"," 'describes our experiment design and Section 6 the results. Section 7 '\n"," 'concludes.We begin with the \"standard\" binary choice threshold public good '\n"," 'frame. Following the approach of Sonnemans et al. (1998) , we will call it '\n"," 'the public good provision frame. It is characterized by players being asked '\n"," 'how much they want to give toward a public good and the positive externality '\n"," 'of contributing is emphasized (Cartwright, 2016) .Specifically, there exists '\n"," 'a set of players = { … } i n 1, , . Each player has to decide whether to '\n"," 'contribute E units of a private good toward a public good. Players make '\n"," 'choices simultaneously and independently. Let The only occasion in which the '\n"," 'framing effect does not exist is if success rates are predicted to be zero '\n"," 'with both frames. 3 Results more consistent with Sonnemans et al. (1998) are '\n"," 'obtained by Bougherara, Denant-Boemont, and Masclet (2011) . They found that '\n"," 'contributions are significantly higher in a creating (public good) frame '\n"," 'than a maintaining (public bad) frame when there is a provision point '\n"," 'mechanism. Moreover, the effect is largely a dynamic one. The key difference '\n"," 'is that Bougherara et al. (2011) consider a setting with continuous choice, '\n"," 'whereas we focus on a setting with binary choice.Given contribution profile '\n"," 'a, let denote the number of players who contribute. There exists an '\n"," 'exogenously fixed threshold level < < t n 1 . The payoff function of player '\n"," 'i is given bywhere > V E is the private return from the public good. Note '\n"," 'that because > V E, it is efficient to provide the public good. Moreover, it '\n"," 'is in the interests of a player to contribute if − t 1 others will '\n"," 'contribute. The set of the Nash equilibrium for the game is characterized by '\n"," 'Palfrey and Rosenthal (1984) .To apply the learning direction theory and the '\n"," 'impulse balance theory, we need to distinguish different experience '\n"," 'conditions (Selten, 2004) . In doing so, we take as given a contribution '\n"," 'profile a and player ∈ i N. We distinguish three key experience conditions. '\n"," 'To calculate expected impulse suppose that each player independently chooses '\n"," 'to contribute with probability p.The expected upward impulse of player = i n '\n"," '1, comes from the lost opportunity condition and is given byPr does not '\n"," 'contribute Pr 1 others contribute 1 1 1 1 .The expected downward impulse of '\n"," 'player i comes from the wasted contribution and OC experience conditions. '\n"," 'From the wasted contribution, it is ( ) In all other conditions, there is no '\n"," 'impulse to change contribution.CARTWRIGHT ET AL.So, the expected downward '\n"," 'impulse of player i isAn impulse balance equilibrium is a value for p such '\n"," 'thatwhere λ is an exogenously given weight on the downward impulse '\n"," '(Ockenfels & Selten, 2005) . The interpretation of λ will be a recurring '\n"," 'theme in the remainder of the paper. Here, we merely note that a value of < '\n"," '1 λ implies a psychological impulse toward contributing (because downward '\n"," 'impulse counts for less). The equilibrium condition equates toWe can '\n"," 'distinguish stable and unstable impulse balance equilibria. We say that an '\n"," 'equilibrium * p is stable if Sonnemans et al. (1998) We next consider, '\n"," 'following the terminology of Sonnemans et al. (1998) , a public bad '\n"," 'prevention frame. This frame is characterized by players being asked how '\n"," 'much they want to take from a public good and the negative externality of '\n"," 'taking is emphasized (Cartwright, 2016) . Although the public bad frame is '\n"," 'equivalent to the public good frame, it is useful to start afresh and '\n"," 'demonstrate equivalence, rather than assume it.In the public bad prevention '\n"," 'frame, each player has to decide whether to withrdaw E units of a private '\n"," 'good It is trivial that the set of the Nash equilibrium in the public bad '\n"," 'prevention frame is equivalent to that in the public good provision frame. '\n"," 'The same is not true, as we shall now show, for impulse balance '\n"," 'equilibrium.If * = p 0 or * = p 1, the definition is amended as '\n"," 'appropriate.We again distinguish three experience conditions. In doing so, '\n"," 'and this is key to our whole approach, we now think of upward as to withdraw '\n"," '(because it is to go from Retaining a homogeneity assumption, let q denote '\n"," 'the probability that each player withdraws. The expected downward impulse of '\n"," 'a player i comes from the lost opportunity experience condition,The expected '\n"," 'upward impulse of player i comes from the wasted contribution and OC '\n"," 'experience conditions, The expected upward and downward impulses as a '\n"," 'function of p in a public good frame CARTWRIGHT ET AL. In this section, we '\n"," 'explore the connection between the public good and public bad frames. Let *( '\n"," ') PG λ denote the set of impulse balance equilibria as a function of λ, '\n"," 'found by solving condition (1). In terms of the public bad frame, if we set '\n"," '− = q p 1 and use ( ) = ( )where p is the probability of contribution. Let '\n"," '*( ) PB λ denote the set of impulse balance equilibria in the public bad '\n"," 'frame.Comparison of conditions (1) and (3) yields the following:This allows '\n"," 'us to directly compare the set of equilibria in the public good and public '\n"," 'bad frames and give insight into a predicted framing effect. If = 1 λ , we '\n"," 'would expect no framing effect on contributions. Previous estimates of λ '\n"," 'are, however, significantly less than one (Cartwright & Stepanova, 2017; '\n"," 'Ockenfels & Selten, 2005) . This suggests that we could expect a framing '\n"," 'effect. To explore this more, we need to look at *( ) PG λ and *( ) PB λ for '\n"," 'different values of λ (focusing on the case of < 1 λ ). Our first '\n"," 'proposition concerns the multiplicity of equilibria.The expected upward and '\n"," 'downward impulses as a function of q in a public bad frameProof. It is easy '\n"," 'to verify that = p 0 is an impulse balance equilibrium for any value of λ. '\n"," 'If > p 0, then we can rewrite condition (1) as ( ) So, Proposition 1 implies '\n"," 'that there is a unique impulse balance equilibrium *( )={ } PB 0.25 0 .More '\n"," 'generally, Proposition 1 shows that if < < 1 λ λ λ , there are multiple '\n"," 'equilibria in the public good frame but a unique equilibrium of zero '\n"," 'contributions in the public bad frame. In the case of multiple equilibria, '\n"," 'we cannot say to which equilibrium a particular group may converge. It does '\n"," 'not seem unreasonable, however, to assume that when there are multiple '\n"," 'equilibria, at least some groups will converge on an equilibrium with '\n"," 'positive contributions.This leads to the following hypothesis., then the '\n"," 'probability of the public good being provided is higher in a public good '\n"," 'than public bad frame.Our second hypothesis details another consequence of '\n"," 'Proposition 1. If < λ λ, then zero contributions is the unique equilibrium '\n"," 'in the public good frame. If, in addition, < 1 λ , then < 1 λ λ and so zero '\n"," 'contributions is the unique equilibrium in the public bad frame., then the '\n"," 'probability of the public good being provided is zero in the public good and '\n"," 'public bad frames.We now consider the cases not covered by Hypotheses 1 and '\n"," '2. If < 1 λ , then hypotheses 1 and 2 cover all cases except < < < 1 1 λ λ λ '\n"," '. In this case, there are multiple impulse balance equilibria in both the '\n"," 'public good and public bad frames. LetWe can also say that If < < 1 λ λ(or < '\n"," '< 1 1 λ λ ) the probability of the public good being provided is higher in a '\n"," 'public bad than a public good frame. Each of these conditions can only hold, '\n"," 'however, if > 1 λ .CARTWRIGHT ET AL.be the equilibrium in the public good '\n"," 'frame with the largest probability of contribution.

'\n"," 'We see that the equilibrium probability of contributing falls within range '\n"," '0.72-0.55 for λ between 0.25 and 1. The corresponding probability of the '\n"," 'public good being provided) ranges between 87 and 59%.Proposition 2 focuses '\n"," 'on the public good frame. It can, however, easily be applied to the public '\n"," 'bad frame.Consider the case < 1 λ λ . Then there are multiple impulse '\n"," 'balance equilibria in the public bad frame. Let . Then there are multiple '\n"," 'equilibria in both the public good and public bad frames. Again, with '\n"," 'multiple equilibria we cannot say to which equilibrium a particular group '\n"," 'will converge. Let us assume, however, that a group converges on either the '\n"," '= p 0 equilibrium or the respective p B or p G equilibrium. 7 Moreover, '\n"," 'assume that a group is as likely to converge on the = p 0 equilibrium in the '\n"," 'public good as public bad frame. 8 Then we obtain a third hypothesis (which '\n"," 'nests Hypothesis 1).Hypothesis 3. If < < 1 λ λ , then the probability of the '\n"," 'public good being provided is higher in a public good than public bad frame. '\n"," 'It is a simple matter to extend Hypotheses 1-3 to other cases such as. We, '\n"," 'though, have focused on the cases that seem most relevant.In the '\n"," 'interpretation of our results, consider first the public good frame. If < 1 '\n"," 'λ , then a player has an impulse to contribute, suggesting a stronger '\n"," '\"psychological\" desire to contribute than to not contribute. Technically '\n"," 'speaking, this means that to obtain an equilibrium we need the strength of '\n"," 'downward impulse to be compensatingly larger Rapoport (1987) and the idea of '\n"," 'a warm glow from giving (Andreoni, 1995) . Sonnemans et al. (1998) also find '\n"," 'that in the public good frame, satisfaction is lowest in the lost '\n"," 'opportunity (or what they call critical noncontribution) experience '\n"," 'condition. This is also consistent with an impulse to contribute.Consider '\n"," 'now the public bad frame. Our analysis is based on the notion that the '\n"," 'change in frame leaves λ unchanged but flips the meaning of upward and '\n"," 'downward. So now the impulse is to withdraw, suggesting a stronger desire to '\n"," 'withdraw (or not contribute) than to not withdraw (or contribute). . This is '\n"," 'not consistent with equilibrium and suggests a tendency toward everyone '\n"," 'withdrawing.One possible explanation for an impulse to withdraw is that a '\n"," 'person feels an entitlement to withdraw. For instance, Sonnemans et al. '\n"," '(1998) find that in the public bad frame, satisfaction is lowest in the '\n"," 'wasted contribution (or futile nonwithdrawal) experience condition. This '\n"," 'suggests that subjects were \"frustrated\" if they missed an opportunity to '\n"," 'withdraw.Let us clarify that we view λ as a psychological parameter, which '\n"," 'is not influenced by the frame. Framing has the effect of changing the '\n"," 'notion of upward impulse so as to influence behavior, taking λ as given. In '\n"," 'particular, the impulse changes from contribute to withdraw. More generally, '\n"," 'however, one could envisage that the change in frame may also change λ. For '\n"," 'instance, the notion that contributing can give warm glow would seem '\n"," 'relatively straightforward, but the idea that withdrawal can give a '\n"," 'similarly sized psychological boost may seem less intuitive.This might '\n"," 'suggest that, say, < 1 λ in the public good frame (because of a warm glow '\n"," 'from contributing) while = 1 λ in the public bad frame (because of an '\n"," 'absence of warm glow). If a change in frame influences λ, then the story is '\n"," '\"less neat.\" The framing effect picked up in Hypotheses 1-3 would, however, '\n"," 'still exist as long as we do not see an extreme jump in λ.It is not our '\n"," 'objective in this paper to consider alternatives to impulse balance. Our '\n"," 'focus is to see whether impulse balance can reliably predict framing '\n"," 'effects. It is, however, worth reflecting on a slightly different approach '\n"," 'to formulating impulse balance equilibrium introduced by Selten and Chmura '\n"," '(2008) , which we will call SC impulse balance equilibrium. This approach '\n"," 'does away with λ but does add loss aversion into the mix. To see how this '\n"," 'works, consider first the public good provision frame. A natural reference '\n"," 'point in this frame is to not contribute and keep the endowment E (Sonnemans '\n"," \"et al., 1998) . Player i's payoff in this case is E, and so a payoff below E \"\n"," 'is interpreted as a loss.The only scenario in which player i earns less than '\n"," 'E is the wasted contribution experience condition. This condition, because '\n"," 'of loss avoidance, is therefore given a higher weight. Specifically, SC '\n"," 'impulse balance equilibrium is obtained by setting, where γ is a parameter '\n"," 'that measures loss avoidance (and was set to 2 by Selten & Chmura, 2008) . '\n"," 'Recall that in our setting, the equilibrium is obtained by settingSo, the SC '\n"," 'equilibrium will differ from the equilibrium we are using (unless CARTWRIGHT '\n"," 'ET AL.). If = λ γ, then the differences will typically be small. 9 If, '\n"," 'however, γ measures loss aversion, then we should have > 1 γ , and yet we '\n"," 'have been suggesting < 1 λ . So, the two equilibria will diverge. Indeed, '\n"," 'when = 2 γ , the only SC equilibrium is = p 0. Essentially, the \"fear\" of '\n"," 'losing E deters people from contributing. This is hard to reconcile with '\n"," 'observed contributions.The key question for us is whether SC impulse balance '\n"," 'equilibrium can capture a framing effect. Here we encounter the further '\n"," 'problem of determining an appropriate reference point. If we adopt the same '\n"," 'reference point in the public bad frame as in the public good frame then we '\n"," 'should observe no framing effect (because the equilibrium condition is '\n"," 'identical in the public good and public bad frame). If, as discussed by '\n"," 'Sonnemans et al.(1998), we put E as the reference point in the public good '\n"," 'frame and 0 as the reference point in the public bad frame, we should obtain '\n"," 'higher, and not lower, contributions in the public bad frame. A further '\n"," 'alternative is to use V as a reference point in the public bad frame to '\n"," 'capture the idea of taking from an existing public good. This gives a result '\n"," 'in the desired direction but only at the cost of seeming too ad hoc.In '\n"," 'short, as Van Dijk and Wilke (1995) highlighted, the appropriate reference '\n"," 'point in threshold public good games is open to interpretation. This is why '\n"," 'we prefer to use impulse balance equilibrium rather than the SC equilibrium. '\n"," 'But the arguably more important thing to take from this discussion is that λ '\n"," 'is distinct from loss aversion. In particular, λ is picking up a \"bias\" '\n"," 'toward being influenced by upward impulse more than downward impulse. '\n"," 'Flipping the interpretation of upward and downward, thus, causes the framing '\n"," 'effect. Adding loss aversion into the mix may further enrich the analysis. '\n"," 'But our results are not driven by a change in the reference point or loss '\n"," 'aversion.Our objective with the experiment is to test the predictions of '\n"," 'Hypothesis 3 and Proposition 1. Setting = n 5 and. If, therefore, we fix = E '\n"," '6 and vary V , then we obtain the values for λ depicted in Figure 3 . Prior '\n"," 'studies suggest that we would expect a value of λ between around 0.25 and 1 '\n"," '(Cartwright & Stepanova, 2017; Ockenfels & Selten, 2005) . This leaves a '\n"," 'region for smaller values of V where we expect the success rate to be '\n"," 'positive with a public good frame and zero with a public bad frame. 10 There '\n"," 'is then a region for larger values of V where we expect the success rate to '\n"," 'be positive in both the public good and public bad frame. Note that '\n"," 'Sonnemans et al. (1998) , after rescaling, had = V 18.5 and so were '\n"," 'seemingly on the boundary where we might expect a positive success rate in '\n"," 'the public bad frame depending on λ. There is a region for V around 6 where '\n"," 'we expect the success rate to be zero in the public good frame. Results from '\n"," 'a separate study of ours (yet to be published) confirm this result.We used a '\n"," '2 × 2 design in which we vary the frame-public good or public bad-and the '\n"," 'return from the public good -= V 13 or 31. 11 Our basic hypotheses are that '\n"," 'there should be a large framing effect when = V 13 and a smaller framing '\n"," 'effect when = V 31. To quantify this, consider Table 2 , in which we detail '\n"," 'P P , G B and the corresponding probability of the public good being '\n"," 'provided when = 0.5 λ . When = V 13, we are predicting a large framing '\n"," 'effect.When = V 31, we predict a smaller but still significant framing '\n"," 'effect. This provides straightforward testable hypotheses.Each session was '\n"," 'organized as follows. Subjects were given instructions for either the public '\n"," 'good or public bad frame. The instructions were written for a specific value '\n"," 'of V , either 13 or 31. The instructions in the public good frame talked of '\n"," 'the positive benefit to the group if group members gave tokens. By contrast, '\n"," 'the instructions in the public bad frame talked of the negative consequences '\n"," 'for the group if group members withdrew tokens. Subjects were then assigned '\n"," 'to groups of five and played the relevant game in fixed groups for 20 '\n"," 'rounds. After 20 rounds, subjects were given a second set of instructions in '\n"," 'which the value of V was changed from 13 to 31 or vice versa.They were then '\n"," 'reassigned to new groups of five and played the relevant game in fixed '\n"," 'groups for a further 20rounds. Note that the frame remained the same over '\n"," 'the 40 rounds. This design allows a between-subject comparison of frame and '\n"," 'a between-and within-subject comparison on the effect of V .After '\n"," 'participants had finished the 40 rounds of choices, they completed a '\n"," 'questionnaire. Other than standard demographic questions, such as gender, it '\n"," 'included a number of questions directly related to the task.Specifically, '\n"," 'subjects were first asked to indicate on an 11-point Likert scale how much '\n"," 'they agreed with the statements, \"I wanted to do the best for the group\" and '\n"," '\"It was important the outcome was fair to all members of the group.\" They '\n"," 'were then given six outcomes and asked to rate on an 11-point scale how '\n"," 'satisfied they would feel with each of the outcomes. The six outcomes '\n"," 'included an example of wasted contribution, lost opportunity, and OC as well '\n"," 'as the case where exactly three group members contribute.The experiment was '\n"," 'run using z-Tree (Fischbacher, 2007) . We initially ran four sessions '\n"," 'corresponding to the four conditions. So, there were two sessions with a '\n"," 'public good frame, one with = V 31 in the first 20 rounds and = V 13 in the '\n"," 'last 20 rounds and one with = V 13 in the first 20 rounds and = V 31 in the '\n"," 'last 20 rounds.Similarly, there were two sessions with a public bad frame. '\n"," 'There were 15 subjects (or three groups) in each session meaning a total of '\n"," '60 subjects. Subsequently, following the comments of a referee, we ran '\n"," 'further sessions to boost the number of observations. A total of 120 '\n"," 'subjects took part in these further sessions equally split across the four '\n"," 'conditions. This means a further 30 subjects (or six groups) per condition. '\n"," 'We highlight that the initial sessions took place in the United Kingdom and '\n"," 'the subsequent sessions in China, and so we shall only pool the data where '\n"," 'analysis (not always reported here) shows no significant differences. '\n"," 'Subjects were paid in cash at the end of the session based on the outcome of '\n"," 'two randomly selected rounds from the experiment.We summarize our empirical '\n"," 'findings with seven results. The first of these reaffirms the main finding '\n"," 'of Sonnemans et al. (1998) , namely that contributions are higher in the '\n"," 'public good provision than public bad prevention frame.Note that throughout '\n"," 'the following, we will define contributors as participants who choose to '\n"," 'contribute in thefor different values of V , and in brackets, the '\n"," 'probability of the public good are provided Let us highlight that we see λ '\n"," 'as a psychological parameter over which we do not have experimenter '\n"," 'control.CARTWRIGHT ET AL.public good frame and opted not to withdraw in the '\n"," 'public bad frame.

'\n"," 'The contribution rate is significantly higher in public good provision '\n"," 'framing than in public bad prevention framing.Evidence for Result 1 can be '\n"," 'seen from Tables 3 and 4. Table 3 reports the average contribution rate over '\n"," '20 rounds in each condition. We report results for the United Kingdom and '\n"," 'China and the pooled results. It also reports, in brackets, the proportion '\n"," 'of times the threshold was met. Note that these numbers can be directly '\n"," 'compared with those predicted in Table 2 . As expected the contribution rate '\n"," 'and success rate are higher in the public good frame compared with the '\n"," 'public bad frame. This holds in both the United Kingdom and China and is '\n"," 'very similar to the effect observed by Sonnemans et al. (1998) , where the '\n"," 'contribution rate was 51.5 in the public good frame and 39.9 in the public '\n"," 'bad frame.The statistical significance levels reported in Table 3 are '\n"," 'obtained from the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test using group average across 20 '\n"," 'rounds as independent observations. As you can see the framing effect only '\n"," 'shows up as marginally significant at best. This is, though, a relatively '\n"," 'conservative test given that we only have 36 observations in total. Table 4 '\n"," 'provides more compelling evidence in support of Result 1. In Column (1), we '\n"," 'report the results of a probit regression with individual contribution as '\n"," 'the dependent variable. In Column (2) we report the results of an ordered '\n"," 'probit with number of contributors in the group as the dependent variable. '\n"," 'And in Column (3), we report the results of a probit regression with group '\n"," 'success as the dependent variable.

In this '\n"," 'and the following tables, the symbols represent ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, and '\n"," '*p < 0.1.The power size of the framing effect ( > PG PB) is 0.758 in = V 13 '\n"," 'and 0.919 in = V 31, which means that there is a 75.8%/91.9% probability '\n"," 'that the results we found will not commit a Type II error.For a further '\n"," 'robustness check, we also run panel regression with random effects with '\n"," 'standard errors clustering at subject level and group level, and the '\n"," 'treatment effects (framing and V ) remain robust. In addition, as discussed '\n"," 'in the later results, the framing effect remains robust with a bootstrap '\n"," 'regression using individual average contribution rate as the unit of '\n"," 'observation (specification 1 in Table 8 ).Result 2.

'\n"," 'This is as predicted and consistent with the general evidence from threshold '\n"," 'public good games (Croson & Marks, 2000) .

Robust standard errors in parentheses. Note. The outcome variable '\n"," 'is the mean contribution rate (in percentage). Standard errors are in the '\n"," 'parenthesis, where unit observation is individual average across the 20 '\n"," 'rounds. Significance levels are derived from the regression results from '\n"," 'Column (1) in Table 4 . r reports the one-sided power analysis of the means '\n"," 'of contribution rate between the two frames with high or low values, where '\n"," 'unit observation is individual average across 20 rounds (in total 60 '\n"," 'observations in the United Kingdom and 120 in China).The regression results '\n"," 'remain robust if the standard errors are clustered at group level. In total '\n"," 'there were 36 clusters (12 groups in the United Kingdom and 24 groups in '\n"," 'China).Result 3. The public good versus bad framing effect is larger with a '\n"," 'high value of V than with a low value.The evidence for this has already been '\n"," 'discussed to some extent. When = V 31, the contribution rate in the public '\n"," 'good treatment is 17.1% higher than that in the public bad treatment. When = '\n"," 'V 13, the relevant difference is 38.3%. The effects of framing in each round '\n"," 'can be seen in Figure 4 . The vertical axis of the gray line (triangle '\n"," 'symbol) represents the difference in average contribution rate between '\n"," 'public good and public bad frame. In most rounds, you can see that the '\n"," 'differences are positive, supporting Result 1. Also, for most rounds, the '\n"," 'difference in = V 13 is above that in = V 31, supporting Result 3.In this '\n"," 'section, we focus more specifically on experience conditions and the '\n"," 'tendency of individuals to change contribution. In doing so, we follow '\n"," 'Sonnemans et al. (1998) in distinguishing between whether a contribution is '\n"," 'futile, critical, or redundant for a particular subject. A contribution is '\n"," 'futile if less than − t 1 others contribute; if a subject contributes when '\n"," 'their contribution is futile then they experience the wasted contribution '\n"," 'experience condition. A contribution is critical if exactly − t 1 others '\n"," 'contribute; if a subject does not contribute when their contribution is '\n"," 'critical, they experience the lost opportunity experience condition. '\n"," 'Finally, a contribution is redundant if more than t others contribute; if a '\n"," 'subject contributes when their contribution is redundant, they experience '\n"," 'the OC condition.In all, this gives us six conditions to consider: '\n"," 'contribute when futile (wasted contribution), contribute when critical, '\n"," 'contribute when redundant (OC), not contribute when futile, not contribute '\n"," 'when critical (lost opportunity),and not contribute when redundant. Note '\n"," 'that impulse balance only picks up three of these possibilities because in '\n"," 'the other three there is no impulse to change.Result 4. In the public good '\n"," 'frame, we see relatively more instances of the OC condition (contribute when '\n"," 'redundant), and in the public bad frame, we see more instances of the not '\n"," 'contribute when futile condition. Figure 5 plots the proportion of each '\n"," 'condition distinguishing by treatment. We can readily see that the '\n"," 'proportions are almost identical except for the contribute when redundant '\n"," 'and not contribute when futile conditions. To be more specific, there is an '\n"," 'around 16% switch from FutileNot to RedunCon as the frame changes from '\n"," 'public bad to public good. The difference is statistically significant '\n"," '(Mann-Whitney test with individual average as independent observations, < p '\n"," '0.001 for RedunCon and = p 0.002 for FutileNot). 15 This is consistent with '\n"," 'an impulse to contribute in the public good frame (subjects are less eager '\n"," 'to move away from OC and wasted contribution) and withdraw in the public bad '\n"," 'frame (subjects avoid wasted contribution). To investigate this further,we '\n"," 'can look at the dynamics of individual choice.Result 5. Participants who did '\n"," 'not contribute in the previous round have a significantly higher probability '\n"," 'of contributing in the current round in the public good frame.In Table 6 , '\n"," 'we report the results of probit regressions with the dependent variable of '\n"," 'whether a subject contributed in round t, specification 1, whether a subject '\n"," 'switched to contribute, specification 2, or deviated to not contribute, '\n"," 'specification 3. Note that switching behavior happened 20.3% of the time, '\n"," 'among which 47.3% switched to contribute. The main independent variables are '\n"," 'the framing, V , whether the public good was successfully provided in round '\n"," '− t 1 and control variables such as China and the ordering of the '\n"," 'sessions.The results remain robust in separate tests for the United Kingdom '\n"," 'and China.Column (1) of Table 6 reaffirms Results 1 and 2 with contributions '\n"," 'higher in the public good frame and when = V 31.Column (2) shows that '\n"," 'subjects in the public good frame have a higher probability to switch to '\n"," 'contribute if they did not contribute in the last round, ceteris paribus. 16 '\n"," 'Indeed, if the condition in the last round condition was Critical-Not, that '\n"," 'is, two others contribute and the participant does not contribute, then the '\n"," 'predicted tendency to switch is significantly higher in the public good '\n"," \"frame (33.9%) than in the public bad frame (17.9%; Fisher's exact test, < p \"\n"," '0.001). Similarly, we find a significantly higher tendency to switch to '\n"," 'contribute in the Futile-Not condition in the public good frame compared '\n"," 'with the public bad frame ( < p 0.001), but not in the Redun-Not condition ( '\n"," '= p 0.48). This starkly illustrates the impulse to contribute in the public '\n"," 'good frame as compared with the public bad frame. Note that in Column (3), '\n"," 'we also examine the tendency to deviate to not contribute, but do not find '\n"," 'significant framing effects.Recall that at the end of the experiment, '\n"," 'subjects filled in a questionnaire in which they were asked how much they '\n"," 'valued the group and fairness and how satisfied they were with various '\n"," 'outcomes.Proportion of contributors in public good and public bad frames by '\n"," 'round for high and low value (pooled data) F I G U R E 5 Proportion (%) of '\n"," 'six possible outcome conditions by treatment (pooled)Note that we obtain '\n"," 'similar results with panel regressions with random effects at the session '\n"," \"level (see the online Supporting Information).Result 6. Participants' \"\n"," 'attitudes toward fairness and OC and critical contribution conditions are '\n"," 'sensitive to framing but concerns for group payoff are not. Table 7 '\n"," 'summarizes the average responses of the post-experimental questionnaire. We '\n"," 'see no significant framing effect in terms of \"I wanted to do the best for '\n"," 'the group.\" In China (but not the United Kingdom), we see significantly more '\n"," 'support in the public bad frame for \"It was important the outcome was fair '\n"," 'to all members of the group.\" Subjects were then asked their satisfaction '\n"," 'with possible outcomes. Overall, we see a much lower level of satisfaction '\n"," 'in the wasted contribution condition. More relevant for us, though, are the '\n"," 'framing effect differences.Here, the effects are mixed and differ in the '\n"," 'United Kingdom and China. We see relatively higher levels of satisfaction in '\n"," 'the OC condition in the public good frame and lower levels of satisfaction '\n"," 'in the Critical-Con condition. Our interpretation of the mixed results is '\n"," 'that although framing has an effect on attitudes these are not the main '\n"," 'drivers of the framing effect we observe in contributions.Result 7. '\n"," 'Participants who state higher preference for group payoff/fairness '\n"," 'contribute more frequently. The correlation between contributions and '\n"," 'preferences for group payoff and fairness is stronger in the public bad than '\n"," 'public good frame. Table 8 reports a linear regression in which the '\n"," 'dependent variable is the number of times a subject contributed over the 40 '\n"," 'rounds. The independent variables include a dummy for the public good frame, '\n"," 'the extent to which the subject agreed with either the statement about group '\n"," 'payoff or fairness, and the interaction between treatment and stated '\n"," 'preference. Here, we separate report the results for the United Kingdom and '\n"," 'China due to different stated preference, as shown in Table 8 . Consistent '\n"," 'with Result 1, the frame is highly significant. As one would expect, '\n"," 'subjects with a higher preference for group payoff or fairness contributed '\n"," 'significantly more often.Most interesting for our purposes is that a '\n"," 'preference for group payoff or fairness was more strongly correlated with '\n"," 'contributions in the public bad than public good frame. Consistent with our '\n"," 'interpretation of Result 6, this T A B L E 6 Probit regression on tendency '\n"," 'to contribute suggests that the framing effect we observe in contributions '\n"," 'goes beyond the framing effect observed in stated attitudes. Specifically, '\n"," 'in the public good frame, it seems as though subjects had a \"bias\" toward '\n"," 'contributing irrespective of social preferences or attitudes. In the public '\n"," 'bad frame, by contrast, we see that contributions are lower and more aligned '\n"," 'with attitudes. We explore possible interpretations of this in the '\n"," 'concluding discussion.T A B L E 7 Agreement and satisfaction levels from '\n"," 'post-experiment questionnaire in the United Kingdom and China Note. '\n"," 'Participants were asked how much they value group payoffs and fairness among '\n"," 'group members, as well as their satisfaction levels under the three key '\n"," 'experience conditions, namely wasted opportunity (WC), lost opportunity (LO) '\n"," 'and overcontribute (OC). In addition, participants also report their '\n"," 'satisfaction levels in Critical-Con (CC) and Redundant-Not (RN) conditions. '\n"," 'All questions are in the 11-point Likert scale from 0 to 10. p-values are '\n"," 'reported from the Mann-Whitney U test, 60 individuals in the United Kingdom '\n"," 'and 120 in China.T A B L E 8 Linear regression on contribution rate over 40 '\n"," 'rounds Note.

Standard errors in parentheses. '\n"," '***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1.In this paper, we have revisited the '\n"," 'framing effect observed by Sonnemans et al. (1998) . They found that '\n"," 'subjects were more willing to contribute to a threshold public good if it '\n"," 'was framed in terms of public good provision rather than public bad '\n"," 'prevention. One key contribution of our work is to demonstrate that impulse '\n"," 'balance theory provides a framework with which to predict the size of the '\n"," 'framing effect. We then test those predictions with a new experiment and '\n"," 'find broad support for them. This adds to the growing evidence that impulse '\n"," 'balance theory can help predict behavior in games (e.g., Cartwright & '\n"," 'Stepanova, 2017; Goerg et al., 2016; Ockenfels & Selten, 2005; Selten & '\n"," 'Chmura, 2008) .Our headline findings are relatively straightforward and '\n"," 'provide a consistent picture. In particular, we observe a framing effect '\n"," 'similar to that of Sonnemans et al. (1998) . The size of the framing effect '\n"," 'is also attenuated, as predicted by the impulse balance theory, by the size '\n"," 'of return from the public good. If the return from the public good is large '\n"," 'then the framing effect is relatively small because the success rate at '\n"," 'providing the threshold public good is relatively high in both the public '\n"," 'good and public bad frame. By contrast, if the return from the public good '\n"," 'is small, then the framing effect is large because the success rate drops in '\n"," 'the public bad frame. The experimental results we observed were also '\n"," 'quantitatively similar to those predicted.Although the headline results were '\n"," 'straightforward, it is interesting to reflect in this concluding discussion '\n"," 'on some of the more subtle findings that are open to interpretation. '\n"," 'Particularly relevant is to look at the role played by the weight on the '\n"," 'downward impulse. Our approach is to assume that a change in frame flips the '\n"," 'notion of upward impulse from that of contributing in the public good frame '\n"," 'to withdrawing in the public bad frame. This makes a difference because the '\n"," 'weight on the downward impulse, λ, is assumed to be less than one meaning '\n"," 'that upward impulses \"count for more.\" So, in the public good frame, there '\n"," 'is a tendency toward contributing, whereas in the public bad frame, there is '\n"," 'a tendency toward withdrawing.A tendency toward contributing in the public '\n"," 'good frame is consistent with the notion of warm glow (Andreoni, 1995 ; see '\n"," 'also Rapoport, 1987) , which may be related to group identity (Chakravarty & '\n"," 'Fonseca, 2017) . And our experimental results in the public good frame are '\n"," 'close to those predicted, when = 0.5 λ . So, the approach we are taking as '\n"," 'regards the public good frame would seem relatively uncontroversial. The '\n"," 'notion that group members have a tendency to withdraw in the public bad '\n"," 'frame would seem more open to question.This posits that not only is there an '\n"," 'absence of warm glow but an additional force pushing toward withdrawal.This '\n"," 'may be the case if people feel an entitlement to withdraw. But our results '\n"," 'cast some doubt on the strength of this force. In particular, we predicted a '\n"," 'zero contribution rate for a low return from the public good and yet the '\n"," 'observed contribution was rate was a sustained 41%.The evidence for '\n"," 'sustained contributions in the public bad frame suggests that the impulse to '\n"," 'withdraw was not as strong as the impulse to contribute. This, in turn, '\n"," 'would mean that the frame changes the weight on the downward impulse. '\n"," 'Indeed, our results are consistent with a value of λ around 0.5 in the '\n"," 'public good frame and around 1 in the public bad frame. This picks up the '\n"," 'impulse to contribute in the public good frame, from warm glow or similar, '\n"," 'but no strong impulse to withdraw in the public bad frame. Such application '\n"," 'of the impulse balance theory could be criticized for the somewhat arbitrary '\n"," 'changes in λ. Let us highlight, therefore, the main counter-argument to this '\n"," 'criticism-namely, that we were able to make clear testable predictions '\n"," 'without arbitrary changes in λ and find evidence in support of those '\n"," 'hypotheses. So, the impulse balance theory still has bite.What our approach '\n"," 'is not able to do is unpick why a warm glow exists (and possibly only '\n"," 'exists) in the public good frame. This could partly be due to confusion '\n"," '(Fosgaard et al., 2017) but that seems unlikely to be the whole story. For '\n"," 'instance, our Results 4-7 suggest that in the public good frame, subjects '\n"," 'are more drawn toward contribution than in the public bad frame. Also, Park '\n"," '(2000) and Kotani et al. (2008) find that those with an individualistic '\n"," 'value orientation are particularly influenced by frame. This points to the '\n"," 'possibility that the public good frame better \"incentivizes\" less '\n"," 'cooperative types. Similarly, beliefs and emotions may play a part (Cubitt '\n"," 'et al., 2011; Dufwenberg et al., 2011) . The value in our approach is that, '\n"," 'taking warm glow as given, we can make reliable predictions on the size of '\n"," 'framing effect observed.We finish with a potential application of our work '\n"," 'to cybersecurity. The main source of cyber-breach within organizations are '\n"," 'phishing attacks in which cybercriminals use sophisticated social '\n"," 'engineering to get victims to reveal sensitive information or transfer money '\n"," '(Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, 2018).Cybersecurity '\n"," 'within an organization can, therefore, be viewed as a form of threshold '\n"," 'public good game in which employees can exert effort to avoid an attack, and '\n"," 'a significant breach is averted if and only if sufficiently many employees '\n"," 'exert effort. Effort may, for instance, include avoiding distractions when '\n"," 'checking emails and seeking advice on nonroutine financial requests. Framing '\n"," 'effects can occur in the training and advice given to employees. A positive '\n"," 'frame would focus on the positive externality of security that results from '\n"," 'effort (e.g., \"checking all nonroutine financial requests with your line '\n"," 'manager before acting makes your company safe\"). A negative frame would '\n"," 'focus on the damage that can result from a lack of effort (e.g., \"clicking '\n"," 'on unsolicited links risks damaging the company\\'s computer systems\"). Our '\n"," 'research suggests that the positive frame will be most effective.
